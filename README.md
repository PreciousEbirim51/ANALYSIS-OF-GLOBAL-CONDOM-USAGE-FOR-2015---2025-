INTRODUCTION

Condoms are a critical tool in global public health, serving as a barrier method for both contraception and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention. Over the past decade, condom usage trends have been influenced by factors such as awareness campaigns, government policies, cultural attitudes, and technological advancements (e.g., improved materials, female condoms).

This analysis examines global condom usage trends from 2015 to 2025, assessing market growth.

DATA CLEANING

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and some precautions were taken even though the dataset was clean. Some of these precautions taken were;

Ensuring absence of empty rows.
Ensuring absence of duplicated rows.
Ensuring the date entries are standardized to a uniform date format.
STANDARD EXCEL TABLE: The dataset was transformed to a standard excel table for easier management and automation.

PRE-ANALYSIS

Pre-Analysis Board

I conducted a pre-analysis process on the dataset before analyzing the dataset on pivot chart. This pre-analysis involves breaking the dataset into meaningful components.

Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.

Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing when the analysis starts proper.

Potential Insights: I was able too uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.

Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.

RECOMMENDATION

1. I recommend that the government subsidize the cost of condoms for their countries especially in disadvantage communities to curtail the spread of STDs such as HIV.

2. Governments should promote local production to drive down the price of condoms in countries that imports theirs.

3. Governments should educate the public on the advantages of using condoms.

CONCLUSION

The global usage of condoms as a primary means of restricting the spread of sexually transmitted diseases has to be considered in the pricing of condoms therefore there is need for government sponsored initiatives to subsidize the procurement and distribution of the condoms in the communities.
